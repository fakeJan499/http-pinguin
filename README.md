# http-pinguin

A simple script that sends http requests mainly to keep constantly running services and applications (in many services, an application that is not used for a certain period of time is stopped and requires manual resumption or its automatic resumption takes a long time).

Information on what requests should be sent and their interval are taken from firebase realtime database.
